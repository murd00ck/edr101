# Vendor Selection EDR 101

The purpose of the repository is to have a toolkit for evaluating the different EDR solutions in the market.


## Motives

In the web you can find different "EDR Buying guides" written by vendors.
Here you have an agnostic point of view where you can start for selecting an EDR solution.
Clone the repo and use the Excel as a checklist.
